## Included Projects

1. **Log Parser**  
   Read server logs, count INFO/ERROR/WARNING entries, find the most frequent error, and group activity by hour.

2. **Data Formatter**  
   Practice designing a modular Python pipeline to ingest and clean multi-format tabular data. 

3. **CSV Transformer**  
   A flexible, config-driven tool for transforming CSV data using pandas — supports filtering, renaming, type casting,
   row cleanup, and sorting, all based on a JSON config file and customizable via CLI flags.

5. **Simple ETL Flow**  
   Ingest JSON data from a public API, transform and normalize it with Python, and export the results to
   both CSV and a SQLite database using a modular, CLI-driven ETL pipeline.

7. **PySpark Starter**  
   Run a word-count or basic aggregation job on a sample dataset using PySpark’s RDD/DataFrame APIs.

8. **Airflow Sim**  
   Mock up a lightweight DAG runner in pure Python to understand task dependencies and scheduling logic.

9. **Trigger-Based News Alert Pipeline**  
   Fetch the latest headlines via an API, clean JSON payloads, and send real-time notifications when keywords appear.
