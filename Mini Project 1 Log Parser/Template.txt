Template: Building a Log Parser

1. Define Requirements:

What log formats do you need to support (e.g. YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS LEVEL Message)?
Which fields matter (timestamp, level, message, IP, user)?
What outputs do you need (counts, top-N errors, time buckets, exports)?

2. Locate & Read the File

Resolve the log path relative to your script (so it works regardless of your current working directory)
Open the file, catch “file not found,” and exit with a clear error if it’s missing

3. Choose a Parsing Strategy

Simple split on whitespace for rigid, known-good formats
Regex with named groups for flexible formats and future drift

4. Loop & Validate

For each line, apply your parser
Skip (and optionally log) any lines that don’t match the expected pattern

5. Collect Metrics

Maintain integer counters for each level (INFO/ERROR/WARNING)
Append every error’s message to a list (for “most common” analysis)
Append each entry’s hour to a list (for hourly histograms)

6. Summarize & Report

Print totals: counts by level
Find top-N: use a frequency map on your error-message list
Hourly buckets: sort your hours list and print HH:00 - N logs

7. Wrap in a if __name__ == "__main__": main() Guard

Prevents side effects on import
Supports dual use
Enables clean testing

8. (Optional) Polish for Production

Add a CLI (argparse) for input file, top-N, output path, debug flag
Use the logging module instead of print() for adjustable verbosity
Offer CSV/JSON exports for dashboards or downstream scripts
Write unit tests for your parse and analysis functions
